# AWS-Storage-Gateway-Backup-Project
 Implementing a secure, scalable backup solution for an on-premises application using AWS Storage Gateway (Tape Gateway), storing backups in Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive for cost-effective long-term retention.
Hybrid Backup Solution Using AWS Storage Gateway
🔧 Project Setup
Install VMware or VirtualBox on your local machine
Download the AWS Storage Gateway VM image
Provision a Linux/Windows VM for your on-prem backup server
🚀 Gateway Configuration
# On AWS Console
1. Go to Storage Gateway
2. Create new Tape Gateway
3. Activate it using the VM IP
4. Allocate buffer and cache disks
5. Create Virtual Tapes
🧪 Testing Backup
# On the backup server
1. Open backup software (e.g., Veeam)
2. Detect iSCSI tape device
3. Run a backup job to the virtual tape
4. Verify data flow to AWS
🌩️ Archive to Glacier
# Tape archiving
1. In AWS Console, eject the tape
2. It will move to Virtual Tape Shelf (S3 Glacier)
3. Set lifecycle policies for retention
📈 Monitoring
Use CloudWatch to monitor gateway health and usage
Enable CloudTrail for audit logs
